The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change. \- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations. \- Is Aven a simple interest loan or does it have an amortization schedule? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Aven offers several balance plans and some of them use the simple interest method of interest calculation.
