Aven's application team will review the documentation within 10 business days. At times, further documentation may be required to complete the process. \- Is there a lien on the home? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Similar to other Home Equity Line of Credit products, a lien is placed on the home for the approved line size amount upon opening the account.
